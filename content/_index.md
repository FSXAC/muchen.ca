# Hello!

My name is Muchen, and welcome to my corner on the internet; here you will find my blogs, course notes, and projects.

I'm a graduate student pursuing a Masters in Applied Science at the [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca), advised by [Prof. Mieszko Lis](http://mieszko.ece.ubc.ca/).
My current work involves computer architecture security and performance simulation using the [gem5](https://www.gem5.org) simulator.

Along with years of teaching assistance at UBC since 2017, my experiences include: UI/UX programming with Frostbite engine and C++ at *[EA - BioWare](https://www.bioware.com)*, FPGA dev-tools development at *[Intel - NSG](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/homepage.html)*, and app-development at *[Vital Mechanics](https://www.vitalmechanics.com)*. See [CV](cv) for more details.
