# Conference 3

## Agenda

### Major Project

#### Thesis

The first stage of the major project.

Intent is to take all the concepts in the course and wrap it around a single comprehensive issue.

The thesis / problem statement could be simple as "evaluating the purchase of a small business that sells artisan goods to a market" etc.. Could be business opportunities,

The idea is to get the thesis out soon, so some feedback / guidance could be provided early on.

#### Outline

The next stage that outlines what kind of analysis that is being conducted, are any non-economic factors that will be included

#### Complete Draft Report

The third stage. Feedback will be provided

#### Final report and Supporting presentation

The last stage

### Assignment 1

Assignment is currently being graded, for any questions about grading, contact TA.

### Assignment 2

Assignment 2 will be released tonight or tomorrow

### Survey

- In class resources, there are textbook problems and solutions
- mixed review in supplementary materials (intent is to provide more perspective in real world)
- 1/3 thinks the videos are too long. Future content will be cut shorter with some contents moved to supplementary materials.
- People requests more examples in videos



## Questions

**Q: How will the presentation work**

> no one will actually have to *give* a presentation. But it needs to be prepared. The presentation needs to have:
>
> - no more tan 15 slides
> - some slide notes (such as one would need to use to present)
>
> No actual *supervisor* is necessary.

**Q: Number of assignments and due dates**

> The number of assignments and key due dates will be updated on the syllabus

**Q: Developed thesis example**

> Because staging for the project is different this term. Past student examples have work that doesn't have a thesis.
>
> Nonetheless, the instructor will write up some sample thesis. They are said to be not complicated.
>
> "*Trying to take an engineering question/decision, and framing it in an economic matter.*"

**Q: Would comparing two different investments be acceptable?**

> It could be a potential, such as comparing two different real estates. Contact instructor for more guidance and discussion.

**Q: what happened with lesson 6?**

> It did exist, but it was taken out. Renumbering later lessons take too much work.

**Q: More lesson modules this week?**

> Soon^TM^

**Q: Do the lesson #'s in the syllabus accurately reflect the lesson # in the modules?  E.g. On the syllabus, cash flow analysis is under 9,10 but is lesson 7 in the modules**

> Names in the syllabus are more general compared to the lesson names - they are not guaranteed to line up.

**Q: Clarify sunk cost (with example)**

> Sunk cost is any money that we spent up to date to do something that cannot be recovered.
>
> An example would be a university degree, we already spent money in lectures, tuitions, books, etc. This is a sunk cost because if we quit school, we cannot get what we spent back.
>
> The money spent before (sunk) is irrelevant to future decisions.

**Q: Difficult part of the course?**

> Risk analysis.
>
> We need to take concepts from early part of the course and trying to assess and quantify equivalent risks and ambiguities.
>
> It's nothing crazy, but involves analysis in multi-dimensions.
>
> Cash flow analysis (including taxes) has terms that are similar sounding. It is essential to keep the definitions straight.

**Q: How do the midterms work?**

> The questions are under works, it could either be a take home exam, or a window of time.
>
> It will cover all materials including "rate of return analysis" including "incremental analysis" and "other analysis".
>
> The format will be half short answer and half long answer.

**Q: Have midterm due on the weekend for people who have workdays?**

> Under consideration

**Q: Where do we hand in the thesis?**

> Canvas
