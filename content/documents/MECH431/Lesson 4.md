# Lesson 4: Payback Period and Cost Benefit Analysis

## Payback Period

The minimum time required such that the revenue pays back all the expense. When considering the payback period, we do not consider the interest rates.

1. **All** costs and benefits are included.
2. **All** economic consequences *after* the payback is **ignored** (as it does not influence the payback).
3. Does not guarantee to provide insight on the most valuable solution / alternative.

## Benefit to Cost Ratio

Comparing the ratio between the cost and benefit can be utilized to make decisions. A solution / alternative is considered economically acceptable if:

- Net value of benefits $$-$$ net value of costs $$\geq 0$$, the more the better.
- Net value of benefits $$\div$$ net value of costs $$\geq 1$$, the more the better.

This set a *minimum financial viability* before any more detailed and sophisticated analysis, which requires more resource and time.
