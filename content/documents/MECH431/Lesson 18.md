# Inflation

**Inflation** is the rise of prices of goods and services (reduction in purchasing power) over time.

Inflation rate can apply to:

- **individual items**: an orange today costs \$0.69 costs \$0.64 last year; the inflation rate is 7.8%
-  **commodity**: inflation rate of bread is taken from average prices
- **basket of goods**: general consumer prices

> **Example**: average inflation rate
>
> Given the base price of \$100 in year 0, inflation rate in year 1 is 5%, year 2 is 3%, what is average inflation rate over two years?

> First, find the *real* price at the end of year 2:

> $$
> 100(1+0.05)(1+0.03)=108.15
> $$
>
> Then take average inflation rate $$f$$ which is constant and plug it into the equation:
>
> $$
> 100(1+f)^n=108.15
> $$

> where $$n=2$$ for 2 years. $$f=3.995\%$$.

## Definitions

- **Inflation Rate** ($$f$$): annual rate of increase of cost to the same goods and services
- **Real Interest Rate** ($$i_R$$ or $$i'$$): *real* growth of money (:x: **excluding** effect of inflation)
- **Real / Constant Dollars** ($R\$$ or $$R_N$$): dollar with constant purchasing power, expressed using base year (:x: **excluding** inflation)
- **Nominal / Market Interest Rate** ($$i$$): rate that one obtains in general market place (:white_check_mark: **includes** inflation and real interest)
- **Nominal / Actual Dollars** ($A\$$ or $$A_N$$): money at face-value

The relationship between real and nominal interest rate is:

$$
(1+i)=(1+i')(1+f)
$$

The relationship between real and nominal dollar is:

$$
R_N=\frac{A_N}{(1+f)^N}
$$

or simply:

$$
R_N=A_N(P/F, f, N)
$$
