# Conference 4

## Agenda

- **Follow up about syllabus confusions from last week:** syllabus has been updated to course content. More clean-up is under way.

### Assignment 1

*Questions on grading go to TA first.*

- Use learning curve to estimate how production processes improve over time.
- If assuming new facility starts at 0th unit, then no profit will be made in 3 years. We will barely breakeven at ~200th unit if we assume we start at 41st unit.
- Marginal cost will just be variable cost.
- Marginal revenue will just be the revenue of selling one more unit, which is $35000.
