### Bibliography

Kamarainen's paper published under *Computer & Education*[^1] argues on how augmented reality (AR) could improve early education field trips. For sustainable development, in alignment with SDG #4 of quality education, it is essential that we convey the accurate message regarding sustainability development. AR technology improves immersion and engagement.

Findings from Merchant et al. [^2] emphasizes on the increased effectiveness of learning in K-12 students using virtual reality (VR) technologies. By investing in development of technology that enables better education (SDG #4), and ultimately raise a future generation that can better help develop more technology to fix climate change (SDG #13).

The article from *ZDNet*[^3] is about application of AR for field technicians. In particular dirty industries such as petroleum industry. Such technology could allow cleaner and more efficient development and engineering of existing industry infrastructures.

Also published under *Computer & Education*, Sommerauer et al.[^4] consolidates the effectiveness of augmented learning using AR technologies over non-augmented learning. Contributing to the SDG goal #4.

Stauskis' paper[^5] provides a case study of Vilnius City on using VR to increase public contribution in sustainable urban planning. The technology provides an efficient method to facilitate broader and more effective public involvement and ultimately increase social and economic sustainability of urban development process.

Todd Steward's article from Dispatch[^6] outlines the benefits of AR tech in trade jobs and engineering. From providing additional resources and assistance during repairs or maintenance, to using AI in combination to make better decisions. Ultimately tackling SDG 13 (climate action) from a bottom-up approach.
