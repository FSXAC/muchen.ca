## Preliminary Spotlight SDGs and Engineered Option

Selected Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs):

1. (4) Quality Education
2. (13) Climate Action

Access to education and quality education (4) is critical to lay a foundation regarding actions taken against climate change and biodiversity loss. After all humans are making all the errors, and many of the unsustainable decisions are due to short-sightedness and lack of understanding of the big picture. We can then consider the direct actions to combat climate change (13). The firm should learn about these two SDGs since the firm is interested in investments regarding climate change and biodiversity loss.

The engineering option I recommend is **Virtual/Augmented Reality**. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) can broaden the vision in education and analysis. The public can experience VR in a big picture to better understand our planet and its systems, where they usually won't see. AR can help in visualization of data and diagnosis of problems.
