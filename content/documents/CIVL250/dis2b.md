> Hate speech is something that is prevalent in our day-to-day lives.  We come across it on social media, in the news, etc. While it is pretty  obvious that hate speech affects everyone, it is tough to understand how  it might relate to engineering and sustainability.

Corporate  social responsibility (CSR) is a company’s commitment to managing the  social, environmental and economic effects of its operations responsibly  and in line with public expectations. Assume if the company was an  engineering firm, it's services and sales would be highly affected by  any form of hate speech originating from the company.

> Hence, I firmly believe that hate speech can very much be  related to engineering and sustainability in a number of cases. As hate  speech, engineering and sustainability are all very wide-ranging terms,  it is important to always look at each case/situation in an isolated  matter.

Hi Sid, :wave:

I find it difficult to believe that everyone encounters hate speech so prevalently in our every day lives. I certainly believe that not everyone experiences hate speech. Could you elaborate on the level of severity of hate speech that you're depicting?

However, this freedom of communications allows people to freely post  about whatever and whomever. This introduces the topic of hate language.  A language which attacks a person or group based on their race, gender,  religion, etc. Each of the aspects of hate speech relates to the SDGs,  with SDG 10 and SDG 5 being the main victims of hate speech and SDG 3  being the major side-effect of the hate language – only negative health  and well-being.

In this case, fake social media accounts were created,  creating a negative image of the girl, eventually leading to the girl’s  death.  This is an extreme case of cyberbullying, but cyberbullying is a  specific application of hate language on social media – negatively  impacting peoples lives from the comfort of their own computer screen.

Hey Jared, :wave:

Indeed the age of social media has our brains tapped into the net for everything we do. 

I noticed that you used the term "hate language". Does this differ from "hate speech"? Are aggressive comments that you don't agree with considered hate language? What about comments or jokes that consists of racial or homophobic slangs?

Regarding SDG 10, I believe the large majority of goals for reducing inequalities involve equal opportunities and eliminate financial bias towards gender, race, and sex, etc. with the exception of 10.2.

Could you elaborate on how hate speech could threaten inclusiveness? It is evident that not all people can get along. An individual certain is not obligated to partake in a group. People who are hateful and produce hate speeches can be inclusive towards other hateful individuals, regardless of their "age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status".
