### Question 8

After a city has established a regional plan that includes specific goals, strategies are then developed to achieve each goal (as an example, recall the week 3 lesson about Vancouver's transportation goal - goal 5 - and strategy 5.1).  What step generally happens after a specific strategy is established?

> Base-line data relevant to the established strategy is collected.
>
> Excerpt from module 4 lesson 4.1.4 "Livability":

### Question 9
