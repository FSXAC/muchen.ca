### Quesiton 1

The annual amount of materials extracted worldwide has decreased sine 1980.

> False

### Question 2

What is dematerialization and what needs to occur for it to happen?

> Dematerialization is the decoupling of economic growth such as GDP from resource consumption.
>
> For this to occur, economic growth must continue, while individual's consumption rate decreases. This is done by:
>
> 1. Government policies
> 2. Business models around efficient processes
> 3. Consumer awareness

### Question 3

Here is the design framework typically used by engineers side-by-side with the framework used by experts in biomimicry:

What are the similarities and differences between these to conceptualizations of design?

> **Similarities**
>
> - Both processes starts with studying the problem, defining the scope and context.
> - Both has a brainstorming/idea generation phase.
> - Both iterates (loops) to incrementally improve the design.
> - Both has a testing phase (emulation step)
>
> **Differences**
>
> - An additional step for biomimicry design process (*discovery*) which involves studying the nature and abstracting its functions.
> - There's a further evaluation phase for biomimicry design process.
> - There seem to be lack of screening/selection (identify most promising solution) phase for biomimicry design process.

### Question 4

Describe an example of design inspired by nature.

> Modern artificial intelligence uses machine learning, and many machine learning frameworks such as neural networks are modeled after biological neurons. 

### Question 5

Describe the Kalundborg Symbiosis, including it's basic concept and specific synergies.

> Kalundbord Symbiosis is another word for Kalundbord industrial ecology.
>
> Collaboration to utilize each other's waste products to form a closed system. The by product of one company is the material of another company (output becomes input).
>
> Environment as foundation, and increases economic prosperity because it's cheaper to re-use materials.

### Question 6

Which of the following are the fundamental foci of the circular economy?

> - design for the long-term
> - reuse everything
> - eliminate waste

### Question 7

The City of Vancouver is planning to be a zero-waste city. In what year do they expect to achieve this goal?

> 2040

### Question 8

Describe three construction materials that can be recycle and/or reused.

> 1. Recycled aggregates
> 2. Asphalt rubber
> 3. Metals
> 4. Rebar

### Question 9

Name the four steps in a formal LCA.

> 1. Goal and scope
> 2. Definition inventory
> 3. Impact assessment
> 4. Interpretation

### Question 10

What functional unit would you use when conducting an LCA comparison between a paper and ceramic coffee cup?

> Number of cups of coffee served before end of life.
