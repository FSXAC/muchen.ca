## Computer Access

Usually students can use the ECE computers by physically go to the computer lab (this is obviously not possible right now). Thus we have to remote-connect into the computers using SSH clients and remote desktop.

### VPN Access

In order to connect to the ECE-SOC computers via SSH or remote desktop, you need to be on UBC myVPN. 

If you’re using Windows and Mac, you can use *Cisco AnyConnect*:

- Download Cisco AnyConnect
- Connect to `myvpn.ubc.ca` and enter your CWL information.

If you’re on Linux, follow the UBC IT tutorial for *OpenConnect*: <https://it.ubc.ca/services/email-voice-internet/myvpn/myvpn-setup-gnulinux>

### Remote Desktop

The remote desktop client we’re using is *x2go*. Details on how to set it up is located on ECE wiki: <https://help.ece.ubc.ca/X2go>.
