## üëã Introduction

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is apparently very popular as a code editors. While it labels itself as only an *editor*, it has many features that enables it to be used like a proper integrated development environment (IDE). I will use CPEN 411 Lab 2 assignment as the sample project to guide the reader through this document. By the end of this document, we should know how to:

- Install C/C++ extensions for VS Code,
- Configure VSC to run the debugger, and
- Use the GDB debugger in VS Code GUI.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Requirements

First we must make sure that we have the tools to build/compile the source files (i.e. running `make` in the terminal should yield no errors). 

Then install *C/C++* extension from VS Code Extensions Marketplace. Click the green *Install* button to install (Figure 1).

</figure>


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Launch

In VS Code interface, go to the *Run* tab in the sidebar (icon shaped like a bug overlaying a play-triangle). Then click on the big blue *Run and Debug* button. If the proper build tools are available, we should see something like in Figure 2. Type or select `C++ (GDB/LLDB)`. You might then be prompted to select either *gcc-7* or *gcc*, this doens‚Äôt matter so I chose *gcc-7*.

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 2. Creating a Launch Configuration File</figcaption>
</figure>

Upon completion, VS Code will immediately try to compile and run whichever file we have open in the active editor window. This will result in compilation error ‚Äî which is expected. Click *Abort*. Now we see the active editor window showing the **launch.json** file as seen in Figure 3.

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 3.</figcaption>
</figure>

This file configures what happens when we ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù from VS Code. 

1. First let‚Äôs change the `name` entry to something more relevant, such as `Build and debug sim-scalar-5`.

2. Change the `program` entry to point to the path of the executable, in our case, this would be: `‚Äú${workspaceFolder}/src/sim-scalar-5‚Äù`. Note that *\${workspaceFolder}* is a VS Code special variable that expands to the root path of the workspace ‚Äî in my case this is the root directory of the Lab 2 assignment.

3. For `args`, this will be the arguments passed into the simulator. For example, if we want to run the *go* benchmark, we would need to specify:

   ```json
   "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/benchmarks/go/go.ss", "9", "9"]
   ```

   Note that the paths must be relative to the workspace root, and each argument are entered as separate strings in a list.

4. For the key `preLaunchTask`, change the entry to some other name like `Make sim-scalar-5`. Note that this is the name of the *task* that will execute before the launch happens. In the next subsection, we will go over how to make a *build task* that is responsible for running `make` so that we have an executable program to launch from.

5. Ensure that the path to launch `gdb` is correct in `miDebuggerPath`.

Once done, our *launch.json* file should look something like this (Figure 4):

<figure class="figure">
<img class="figure-img" src="assets/Screen Shot 2020-11-04 at 19.45.46.png">
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 4.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Configure a Build Task

In this subsection, we will configure a task to run `make`. 

1. Open the VS Code Command Palette, then select *Tasks: Configure Task*, then *Create tasks.json from template*, then *Others*. A new json file should open up.

2. Change `label` to the same string as what we set in `preLaunchTask` in *launch.json* ‚Äî which is `Make sim-scalar-5`.

3. Change `cmd` to the command we want to run in the shell, which is to run `make`:

   ```json
   "command": "make -C ${workspaceFolder}/src"
   ```

   Note that here we use the flag `-C` to tell *make* to change directory to the *src* subdirectory.

Once we are done, it should look like Figure 5:

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 5.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Makefile Compiler Flags

Since we‚Äôre debugging, let‚Äôs open up *src/Makefile* and make sure that no optimzation is set to be performed during the compilation. In the *Makefile*, sure that optimzation flags (`OFLAGS`) have `-O0` for no optimization and `-g` to generate debug information:

```makefile
OFLAGS = -O0 -g -Wall
```


## üêõ Running and Debugging

Once the steps described above is done, headback to our code (*sim-scalar-5.c*), go to the *Run* tab on the sidebar, and notice that we have a launch configuration ready to go (Figure 6):

</figure>

### Adding Breakpoint

To add a breakpoint, simply click the left margin near the line number to add a red dot üî¥ symbolizing where the program should break out at as seen in Figure 7. This is equivalent of using `break` or `b` in GDB.

<img class="figure-img" src="assets/image-20201104195740317.png">
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 7.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Start

Click the green triangle at the top of the *Run and Debug* panel or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>F5</kbd> to start debugging. From here on now, users of Visual Studio IDE would find debugging very familiar.

### Stepping

As seen in Figure 8, we have paused at the line where we set the breakpoint. The toolbar at the top of the VS Code window provides controls to: continue, step over, step in, step out, restart, and stop the debugger. The lefthand *Run and Debug* panel shows local variables, watched variables, and the callstack.

</figure>

### Debug Console

The *Debug Console*, shown as a tab in the bottom panel in Figure 9, can be used to enter commands for the debugger. For instance, we can call a function (Figure 9):

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 9.</figcaption>
</figure>

Then go back to the *Terminal* tab to see the resulting output of the function call (Figure 10):

## üëè Conclusion

This concludes a short ‚Äútutorial‚Äù on how to configure VS Code to build a project from Makefile, running, and debugging the code. Using the VS Code debugger can potentially significantly speedup the workflow for someone like me ‚Äî who‚Äôs grown up using visual/GUI applications and is more comfortable with it.
