## Professionalism

Professionalism requires a set of attitudes and behaviors that may be related to:

- Honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness
- Respectfulness
- Fairness
- Knowledge and competance
- Knowing ones limitations
- Lifelong learning
- Efficiency and time management
- Open-mindedness
- Accountability
- Altruism

Generally the role of engineers is to demonstrate professionalism and adhere to code of ethics. Specifically engineers: *protect the public* and *serve public interest*. Where “public interest” means the benefit to the general public — net benefit vs costs to the public.

To **protect the public**, engineers minimize risk of failure that impact public safety. To **serve public interest**, engineers reduce negative society, environmental, and economical impact.

### Regulation

EGBC regulates engineering practices in BC. They uphold and protect public interest with respect to engineering.

**Self regulation** is regulation of a profession by members themselves. In BC, engineering is self-regulated. The alternative is direct regulation by government bodies. 

EGBC, along with other associations make up *Engineers Canada* which includes *Canadian Engineering Accredidation Board (CEAB)* for accreding engineering programs and *Canadian Engineering Qualification Board (CEQB)* for developing national guideines for engineering qualifiations and standards. 

### P.Eng

Requirements:

- Canadian citizen or permanent residence
- Completed accredited program
- 4 years of engineering experience (at least 1 year in Canada)
- Attend law and ethics seminar
- Attend professional practice exam
- English language competency
- Evidence of good character

Benefits:

- Employment requirement of many positions
- Right to practice professional engineering
- Right to P.Eng title
- Prestige, distinction, and professional excellence
- Engagement in professional committees
- Access to EGBC publications, service, professional development, etc.

Types:

- Engineering Licensee — can practice within a prescribed scope
- P.Eng with non-practicing status
- Non-Resident Licensee — licensed to practice in BC
- Inter-Association Mobility Agreement — P.Eng or EIT from another province
- International Agreement — P.Eng from another country
- Provisional Member - applicants working towards one-year experience in Canada requirement

### EIT

Recall from [week 2](./Week-2), engineers-in-training status are granted to graduated people working towards P.Eng. Experience requirement is under P.Eng supervision.

### Iron Ring

A ritual to serve as a reminder of the obligations, ethics, and humility associated with the profession.

## Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest arises when a professional has a special interest that influences their professional duties. 

Special interests typically consists of:

- self-interest like job, career, reputation, etc.
- financial relationdships with family or friends
- loyalty
- emotional connection

Professional duties typical consists of:

- *duty of care* and standard of care
- confidentiality
- impartiality/fairness when making decisions/evaluations
- fiduciary duties

COI could result in:

- Damage to reputation and career
- Damage to company
- Damage to the profession
- Criminal and civil charges

### Not COI

- **Conflicting interest** is not a COI
- **Conflicting legitimate obligations** are not COI
- **Ethical Dilemma** is not COI

### Types of COI

- **Actual** COI: evidence of interference of professional duties by special interests is beyond reasonable doubt.
- **Potential** COI: current situation does not infer an actual COI, but could lead to an actual COI through a possible chain of events.
- **Apparent** COI: is not an actual COI, but to a reasonable person/outsider the situation would appear to be an actual COI.

We want to avoid any of these cases.

### Cause of COI

Fundamentally COI is a battle between self-interest against interest of others. **Self-interest** is from *automatic mental processes*, which leads to *latent biases* such as:

- self-perception
- implicit prejudice
- favoritism

**Automatic processes** are opposite of **controlled processes**. They are done subconciosuly and its influence on decision-making is difficult to eliminate, i.e. COI is inevitable.

| Automatic processes           | Controlled Processes            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Fast (parallel processing)    | Slow (serial processing)        |
| Effortless                    | Effortful                       |
| Involuntary                   | Voluntary                       |
| Inaccessible to introspection | Introspective                   |
| Acts on **self-interest**     | Acts on **professional duties** |

Since automatic processes cannot be eliminated, if we foresee COI, we must:

- Try to avoid it
- Disclose to all concerned; not that this does not eliminate or mitigate COI
- Recuse — disqualify oneself from any decisions



# Quiz

- The conflict between professional duties and personal morality (ethical dilemma) is not a conflict of interest.
- Negative consequences of conflict of interst could include: damage to work colleagues or company, damage to reputation and career, and possible criminal and civil charges.
- The CEAB is responsible for accrediting all Canadian university engineeing programs to ensure schools are meeting criteria regarding faculty expertise and student knowledge base.
- A P.Eng from another country cannot immediately obtain a P.Eng license upon starting a new job in Canada — at least 1 year of experience in Canada is required.
- The EGBC is given authority from *The provincial Engineers and Geoscientists Act*.
- A code of conduct, for example, could be policies established to outline environmental responsibility, conflict of interest, workpalce safety and alcohol and drug use.
- Engineers usually don’t have fiduciary duties.
- It is not possible to completely separate one’s personal interest from their professional duties  because the brain associated with emotions do not operate independently of those associated with cognition and control.
- If one has completed 4 years of engineering work experience, the CEAB would be the organization responsible for taking issues with them.
