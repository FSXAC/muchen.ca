# Introduction to Capstone Projects

Capstone projects are defined by industry partner, the problems are not canned and are often open-ended. Interaction with the clients is important, specifically: professional attitude, timely, and excellent communication.

## Instructors

The role of the instructor is only the “mentor” and does not contribute to the project or solution. In certain circumstances the instructor will help down-scale or re-scope, in rare cases, up-scale. 

## Teacher Assistants

TAs are the first line of assistance, they provide mentorship for both technical and management problems. Additional TAs are available for *communication* related tasks such as exchanges and video production.

## Evaluations

Results weigh more than the process. The key deliverables at the end of the project include a technical dossier with documents on **requirements**, **design**, and **validation/testing**. Deliverables may also include but not limited to: **prototype**, **video**, **poster**, or **presentation**.

## Milestones

There are three milestones. For these milestones, abundant feedback is provided such that the teams could iterate and improve over each milestones.

### Milestone 1

Defining the requirements and breaking down the problems. 

### Milestone 2

Have an idea of how we are going to implement solution.

### Milestone 3

A draft prototype. The basic idea should be implemented

### Milestone X (Summative)

This milestone is for the final deliverables. After this milestone, the final grade is determined.

## Workflow

### Lectures

There are mandatory lectures such as notifications and announcements, and optional lectures. Options lectures consist of industry workshops / presentations. Most of the lectures are optional.

### Weekly Meetings

There are weekly meetings with TAs and instructors. Each team has a different time booked for the meeting. The timeslots are unassigned (hence the 15:30 to 17:30 timeslot on the time table).

It is recommended that during this time, we don’t book another class during this time.

## Team Composition

The team area composed such that high grade students are mixed with low grade students. This is so that UBC capstone reputation isn’t ruined if there exists a group of completely incompetent students.

## Meetings

The meetings occur normally on Tuesday or Thursdays 15:30 to 17:30 one group at a time. Most meeting are held in Kaiser, Macleod, and Orchard commons.
