Given an *uniform random variable*, how do we generate random numbers with a specific probability distribution?

## Inverse Transform Algorithm

### Discrete Random Variables

To generate discrete random variables with distribution $$\mathbb P(X=x_i)=p_i$$, for $$i=1,\dotsc,n$$, we follow the following algorithm.

1. Generate continuous uniform random variable $$Y\sim U(0,1)$$
2. Set $$X$$ based on  where $$Y$$ is on the distribution:

$$
X=\begin{cases}
x_1& Y\in[0,p_1)\\
x_2 & Y\in[p_1, p_1+p_2)\\
x_3 & Y\in[p_1 + p_2, p_1 + p_2+p_3)\\
\vdots & \vdots\\
x_n & Y\in[\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}p_i,1)
\end{cases}
$$

#### Continuous Random Variables

To generate continuous random variables with distribution $$F_X(x)$$, follow these steps:

1. Generate continuous uniform random variable $$Y\sim U(0,1)$$
2. Find the inverse of the continuous distribution $$F_X^{-1}(x)$$
3. Set $$X=F_X^{-1}(Y)$$

"Pseudo" Proof: Suppose we have the uniform random variable $$Y\sim U(0,1)$$ and we use the inverse distribution function $$F_X^{-1}$$ to obtain random $$X$$. Note that the distribution function for $$Y$$ is, by definition, $$P_Y(Y<y)=y$$.

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb P(X\leq x)&=\mathbb P(F_X^{-1}(Y)\leq x)\\
&=\mathbb P(Y\leq F_X(x))\\
&=F_X(x)
\end{align}
$$

Which is what we wanted.

> **Note**: This method does not work directly on Gaussian random variables, use [Polar Algorithm for Gaussian random variables](#polar-algorithm) instead.

## Polar Algorithm

As noted above, we can't use inverse transformation method for Gaussian random variables. In order to simulate continuous random variable to have the distribution $$F_X(x)=N(0,1)$$, we need to follow these steps:

1. Generate continuous uniform random variables $$Y_1\sim U(0,1)$$ and $$Y_2\sim U(0, 1)$$
2. Set $$D=-2\ln(Y_1)$$
3. Set $$\Theta=2\pi Y_2$$
4. Set $$X=\sqrt{D}\cos(\Theta)$$; $$X$$ is now a random variable with distribution $$N(0,1)$$
5. Set $$Z=\sqrt{D}\sin(\Theta)$$; $$Z$$ is now a random variable with distribution $$N(0,1)$$ that is also independent from $$X$$

To obtain a random variable with non-standard normal distribution $$Z\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$, we use the *linear properties* of the Gaussian random variables.

1. Generate $$X\sim N(0,1)$$ using steps 1-4 above
2. Set $$Z=\sigma X + \mu$$; $$Z$$ is now a random variable with distribution $$Z\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$

## Composition Method

Use this method if the distribution function $$F_X$$ is composed of a sum of other distribution functions $$F_{X_i}$$:

$$
F_X(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i F_{X_i}(x)\qquad\sum_{i=1}^n p_i=1,\qquad p_i\geq 0
$$

Where $$F_{X_i}$$ are CDFs.

To get a random variable with distribution $$F_X$$, follow these steps:

1. Generate a random variable $$I$$ with discrete distribution $$\mathbb P(I=i)=p_i$$ for $$i=1,2,\dotsc,n$$ using the *Inverse Transform* method for discrete random variables
2. Generate a random variable $$Y_I$$ with distribution $$F_{X_I}$$ using the *Inverse Transform* method for continuous random variables
3. Set $$X$$=$Y_I$$; $$X$ is now a random variable with distribution $$X\sim F_X(x)$$

## Acceptance-Rejection Method

We can use this method if it's hard to use previous methods to generate a random variable $$X$$ with distribution $$F_X$$.

So we find a *proposal distribution* $$F_Y$$ where it is easy to sample. Note that we must ensure the range of the density functions, $$f_X$$ and $$f_Y$$ are the same.

Next, we need to know the upper bound $$a$$, where $$a\geq \frac{f_X(x)}{f_Y(x)}$$.

With all that in mind, we may begin the algorithm:

1. Generate a random variable $$Y$$ from the distribution $$F_Y$$ using methods previously described
2. Generate a uniform random variable $$Z\sim U(0,1)$$
3. Check if $$Z \leq \frac{f_X(Y)}{a f_Y(Y)}$$
   - If true (accept), then set $$X=Y$$
   - Else (reject), go back to step 1 and try again

> **Note**: The probability of $$Y$$ being accepted is $$\frac{1}{a}$$, therefore we should always choose $$a$$ to be as small as possible given $$a\geq 1$$.

## Vector Random Variables Generation

Suppose we have a vector consists of two random variables where $$(x, y)\sim F_{X,Y}(x,y)$$.

If $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are independent. Great! Then we can just generate each of them independently.

If not, then the algorithm is as follows:

1. Express the joint PDF of the two random variables as a conditional PDF

   $$
   f_{X,Y}(x,y)=f_{y\vert x}(y\vert x)f_X(x)
   $$

2. For $$i=1,2,\dotsc,n$$ do:

   1. Generate $$x_i\sim f_X(x)$$
   2. Generate $$y_i\sim f_{Y\vert X}(\left.\cdots\right\vert _{x=x_i})$$

> **Example**:
>
> Suppose $$f_{X,Y}(x,y)=x+y$$ and $$0\leq x,y \leq 1$$, then the marginal PDF for $$X$$ is
>
> $$
> f_X(x)=\int_0^1 f_{X,Y}(x,y)\mathrm dy=x+\frac12
> $$
>
> Next, using the marginal PDF for $$X$$, we can find the conditional PDF:
>
> $$
> f_{Y\vert X}(y\vert x)=\frac{f_{X,Y}(x,y)}{f_X(x)}=\frac{x_i+y}{x_i+\frac{1}{2}}
> $$
>
> Following the rest of the algorithm, we sample $$x_i\sim x+\frac12$$ and sample $$y_i\sim \frac{x_i + y}{x_i + \frac12}$$ for all $$i$$'s.
